#  Multi-Agent Research System

## Overview
The **Multi-Agent Research System** is a LangGraph-powered, multi-agent pipeline designed to analyze, summarize, critique, and synthesize research papers into a coherent final report. Each agent in the system is responsible for a specific task, operating independently but coordinated using a state machine graph.

## Agent Roles

| **Agent**             | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Research Agent`      | Uses LLMs and vector search to extract academic context from documents.     |
| `Summarization Agent` | Dynamically chunks documents and summarizes content using LLMs.              |
| `Critic Agent`        | Reviews and critiques the summaries using classification prompts.            |
| `Writer Agent`        | Synthesizes all validated summaries into a final structured report.          |

## Features Summary

| **Feature Category**     | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chunking                 | Dynamic chunking using token-based segmentation.                                |
| Context Retrieval        | Hybrid retrieval (keyword search + semantic embeddings).                        |
| Agent Communication      | Managed using `LangGraph` state transitions.                                   |
| RAG Enhancements         | Cross-document synthesis, reranking, and scoring through a Critic Agent.        |
| Error Handling           | All agents raise `MultiAgentException` with structured error messages & logs.   |

=== FINAL REPORT ===

## High-Quality Insights:
Deep learning AI algorithms can accurately detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images, allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment to help prevent 
vision loss in diabetic patients.
Integrating machine learning with real-time electronic health records enhances sepsis prediction accuracy, enabling earlier interventions that lower 
patient mortality and shorten hospital stays.
Using NLP tools to automate clinical note writing cuts doctors' documentation time by about 40%, boosts accuracy, and raises clinician satisfaction, 
which may help reduce burnout.
